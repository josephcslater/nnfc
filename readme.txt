The scripts in this folder should only be used with great care. If accidentally applied to files with DOS EOL characters, you will end up with double EOL characters, and you will be very mad. If you feel comfortable using these scripts, then you feel comfortable editing them to repair your files. If you don't feel comfortable editing these scripts to fix damaged files, don't use them.
